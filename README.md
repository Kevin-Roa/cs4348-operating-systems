# CS4348 - Operating Systems
- Project 1
  - Simulate the CPU and memory of a simple computer
  - Implement a specialized instruction set for the simulated computer
  - Fork multiple processes and use inter-process communication to handle the various behaviors between CPU and memory
  - Understand the following concepts:
    - Instruction behavior
    - Registers
    - Stack processing
    - Procedure calls
    - System calls
    - Interrupt handling
    - Memory protection
    - I/O
    - Virtualization/Emulation
  - Written in C++ using forks/pipes
    - A unix environment is required for this to function
- Project 2
  - Simulate a theater situation using threads to handle the various behaviors
  - Utilize semaphores to handle coordinated concurrency and mutual exclusion across threads
  - Concurrent operation with 50+ threads
  - Understand the following concepts:
    - Semaphores
    - Concurrent and parallel execution
    - Mutual exclusion
  - Written in C++ using pthreads
    - A unix environment is required for this to function
